# Access control system through biometric fingerprint sensor

The present project performs the development of a system fulfills two functions, the first is to control the opening of doors by means of a subsystem that collects the data sent by the fingerprint sensors, which are processed to verify the permissions of a user to access by one of the doors. The second function is to make an interface bridge between the fingerprint sensor and the MQTT server, this latter will be the one that sends the commands to perform some action on the sensors such as for example recording a fingerprint in a defined position of the database.

This project also develops the necessary programs for both functions of the obtained hardware, in turn develop the databases that are used for the sequences of actions of the system, as well as for storing users data and system components.

It will be analyze the most important concepts of physical security of environments and infrastructure that are contrasted with national and international standards. For this reason also It will be performs a study of the vulnerabilities of the system developed and the steps to follow to avoid attacks or failures in this system.

Finally, will be performs a study of costs and a comparison of the proposed system against a system of similar characteristics that can be found in the market, in order to conclude with the realization of a pilot installation in the data center of the Agency for the Development of The Information Society in Bolivia.
